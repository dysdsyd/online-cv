education:
    - degree: BTech in Electronics & Communication Engineering
      university: Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad
      time: 2013 - 2017
      gpa: GPA: 8.75/10
        
experiences:
    - role: Data Science Associate
      time: July 2017 – Present
      company: ZS Associates, Pune
      details: |
        - Designed a real-time video recognition system to create a digital understanding of blackjack players at an entertainment center, which proposed over \$100MM of savings 			annually. Employed Mask R-CNN followed by a Fully ConvNet model to get the frame level 			information and stitched them in time using blackjack game play conventions. 
        - Performed Monte-Carlo simulations to understand the customer journey and luck induced volatility in their play behavior to tailor the promotion techniques at an entertainment 		 center effectively.
        - Implemented a multi-sized ConvNet with varying window sizes to detect and identify the adverse effects of a medical drug from live twitter feed. 
        - Identified Key Opinion Leaders in the health-care domain from Twitter data by leveraging page-rank algorithm.
        - Implemented a LSTM based Autoencoder pipeline for a manufacturing client to analyze the real-time sensor data and predict anomalies in their batch and suggested key-drivers for 			non-conformance.

    - role: Data Science Intern
      time: Mar 2016 – July 2016
      company: Analytics Vidhya, Gurugram
      details: |
        - Conducted research on various classification, regression and clustering algorithms to create content for blogs and course material for data science enthusiasts.
        - Built a recommendation engine for the job portal using a hybrid recommender system in python and its deployment led to a saving of 120 man-hour per month of the MIS team. 
        
    - role: Summer Internship
      time: June 2015 - July 2015
      company: Texas Instruments - CEPD Lab, NSIT Delhi
      details: |
        - Worked on register level programming, Embedded Systems and PCB designing.
        - Implemented a game of dodge the wall in Embedded C. Also, developed  a  motherboard from scratch to station microcontroller, display and other components.

        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/kaggle-fisheries-steller-sea-lion"
        tagline: "Implemented a fully connected convolutional neural net (FCNN) to count the number of different sea lions in aerial photographs. Also, experimented with U-Net and TIRAMISU semantic segmentation architectures."

      - title: Traffic Sign Recognition System
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/Traffic-Sign-Detection-Thesis"
        tagline: "Augmented the ResNet'15 ConvNet with a detector box at the top layer to induce attention towards the traffic signs present in the frame. It increased the accuracy by 2% on the LISA dataset as compared to vanilla ResNet."

      - title: Quora Question Pair Similarity
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/kaggle-question-pairs-quora"
        tagline: "Built an ensemble of LSTM and XGBoost models with over 80 linguistic features (word2vec, SVD, TF-IDF etc) to predict the similarity between question pairs on the Quora platform."

      - title: Smart Shower
        link: "https://www.instructables.com/id/The-know-it-all-Shower/"
        tagline: "Built a prototype of a smart shower using Arduino, which gets activated upon sensing the presence by using an ultrasonic sensor and responded by adjusting the water temperature."
