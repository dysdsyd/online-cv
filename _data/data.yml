experiences:
    - role: Graduate Student Instructor
      time: Jan 2019 – Present
      company: University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
      details: |
       - Assisting faculty members with classroom instruction material, code-base development and mentoring grad students with their projects for ARCH 662 Thesis Studio - Architecture & Artificial Intelligence course
        
    - role: Data Science Associate
      time: July 2017 – May 2019
      company: ZS Associates, Pune
      details: |
       - Developed a real-time video recognition system to create a digital understanding of blackjack players at an entertainment center. This digitized information opens up multiple analytical avenues that can help creatively assess value of a table game player
       - Implemented a multi-sized ConvNet with varying window sizes to detect and identify the adverse effects of a medical drug from live twitter feed
       - Implemented a LSTM based Autoencoder pipeline for a manufacturing client to analyze the real-time sensor data and predict anomalies in their batch and suggested key-drivers for non-conformance

    - role: Data Science Intern

      - title: 3D Style Transfer
      	tagline: "Currently working with Prof. Justin Johnson on combining 3D single image view synthesis and style transfer to achieve 3D stylistic editing of models."
    
      - title: MedLens
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/MedLense"
        tagline: "Used Bi-Directional Attention Flow network (BiDAF) to develop a web app for health-care researchers, which answers factual questions based on uploaded documents or searched on PubMed database."

      - title: NOAA Sea Lion Population Count
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/kaggle-fisheries-steller-sea-lion"
        tagline: "Implemented a fully connected convolutional neural net (FCNN) to count the number of different sea lions in aerial photographs. Also, experimented with U-Net and TIRAMISU semantic segmentation architectures."

      - title: Traffic Sign Recognition System
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/Traffic-Sign-Detection-Thesis"
        tagline: "Augmented the ResNet'15 ConvNet with a detector box at the top layer to induce attention towards the traffic signs present in the frame. It increased the accuracy by 2% on the LISA dataset as compared to vanilla ResNet."

      - title: Quora Question Pair Similarity
        link: "https://github.com/syeddanish41/kaggle-question-pairs-quora"
        tagline: "Built an ensemble of LSTM and XGBoost models with over 80 linguistic features (word2vec, SVD, TF-IDF etc) to predict the similarity between question pairs on the Quora platform."
